Ideas for data investigation/plots:

L/R counts bar graph for time of day (sleep, afternoon, evening)

mean daily feeding per week

Stacked bar for L/R/bottle counts per month

Stacked bar for hrs slept, night + nap(s) per month

Time sleeping in one day vs time eating in one day (correlated?)

Do naps that immediately follow nursing last longer than ones that don't? (Time since last nurse vs. length of nap)

Frequency of bottle feedings per month (have bottle feedings become more rare with age?)

make keys of month (0,1,2...) and week to .groupby() and perform summary stats on

Does the baby tend to nap longer immediately following a feeding?

Do the number of naps or cumulative napping time have an impact on the number/frequency of nighttime wakings or total sleep time?

Has the baby shown changes in patterns of feedings/sleeping as time progresses?

Does the baby tend to nurse on both sides more often (thus consuming more milk at a time) as the months have passed?

time vs total feed?  total feed per day vs date?
